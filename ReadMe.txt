1. Environment Preparation
(1) Go Version 1.16
(2) IDE: GoLand

2. Run Test
(1) The code and run examples are included in `Code' and `ExpData' directories. 
(2) You can find the test code entry in `main.go'.
(3) You change the `p1Path' and `p2Path' in `main' function with samples in `ExpData/FindDiff_Effectiveness' directory, where *p1.txt is the default plan generated by the optimizer 
and *p2.txt is another plan with better performance of the same query and then run the code to obtain the results. 
Note that the human-readable format of these are inclucded in `ExpData/Readble'.
